# ExtremeVulnerableDriver

This is a XNU (IOKit) kernel extension inspired by the `hacksysteam/HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver` written by me (TrungNguyen1909)

**ExtremeVulnerableDriver** is intentionally vulnerable XNU driver developed for security enthusiasts to learn and polish their exploitation skills at Kernel level.

## Types of vulnerabilities

- Stack buffer overflow (based on matesCTF's KSMASH Linux kernel Exploit challenge)

- Heap buffer overflow (stereo-typed version of IOAccelerationFamilyV2. rteplica of CVE-2020-3837 bug)

- The one I accidentially made and haven't noticed yet.

## Task

The task is simple: Elevate to root. TFP0 if possible.

## Solutions

Solutions for vulnerabilties are put inside [exploits](./exploits) folder. Please include the vulnerability's name you exploited, the macOS build version and first 6 characters of the sha1 of the driver's commit that you worked on in the file name.

This is because offsets may be subjected to changes between macOS or driver version.

## Contributions

Are welcome (including driver code and exploits)
